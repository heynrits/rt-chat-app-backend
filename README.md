# Real-Time Chat Web Application (Back-End)

This project is the back-end server of a simple chat application with real-time features implemented using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/). My main objective for the entirety of this project was to implement real-time web app features, hence, to focus on my objective, other essential features present in production-ready chat apps such as authentication and encryption were intentionally left out.

## Technologies Used
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)

## Features
- Socket.IO server
- Rest API

## Constraints
- user authentication and message encryption are not implemented

## Setting up
### Environment Variables

### Installing packages

npm i
```
### Running the app locally
```
npm run dev
```
